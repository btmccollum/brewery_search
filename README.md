# BrewerySearch

BrewerySearch provides a CLI that allows a user to navigate BrewBound's brewery database and retrieve additional information such as contact information, social media links, general overview, and more.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brewery_search'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brewery_search

## Usage

Type the following to get started:

    $ brewery-search

Follow the on-screen prompts to continue.

Users will have the ability to search by state abbreviations (case senstitive). From there a user will be presented with a list of all registered breweries in that state. A user can call 

    $ city 

to receive a prompt to filter by a specific city, otherwise they can select the number of any brewery for more information.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
